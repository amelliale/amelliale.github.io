subtitle: Thuy is in Tokyo

My name is Thuy. I have the following qualities:

- I speak Vietnamese, English and Japanese
- I'm an introvert and an INTJ girl, which means that: I prefer to be alone most of the time but I like being near the people who I hold dear.

What else do you need?

### My story
